Vanessa Timmer from One Earth lead a dialogue in our classroom some months ago. The morning that we spent with her has had one of the most enduring impacts on my Semester in Experimental Futures. She illustrated a useful distinction between the ways we think about the future: forecasting vs. backcasting. Forecasting is envisioning what will happen in the future as imperative, and not envisioning how our current actions have an impact on that. Backcasting is envisioning what will happen in the future in a more normative sense, and envisioning the steps we need to take to get there (sort of similar to goal setting).

In a lot of ways, your vision of the future is prophetic no matter which approach you take. Whatever vision you have of the future, it informs the actions you take now, which essentially create your future - most likely in line with your original prediction.

This is the most compelling rationale I have ever heard for the importance of maintaining a positive outlook on life. Furthermore, eternal pessimism is essentially pointless. BE HAPPY OR SUBMIT YOURSELF TO NIHILISM AND/OR MASOCHISM.
