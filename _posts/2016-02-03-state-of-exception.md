Here is a shot at explaining the State of Exception, as posited by Giorgio Agamben, by what little I know about homo sacer:

In Ancient Rome, homo sacer was a figure in the community that could not be sacrificed because their life had no value, and who could be killed without it being considered murder. According to Agamben, this tells us two things about the nature of the state: (1) that the state effectively decides who is in the state and who is out of the state even if they are within geographic limits (what he defines as sovereignty) and (2) that this gives the state the power to decide who will receive what rights. When someone is considered 'outside' of the state, and therefore has their rights restricted, then you have a State of Exception.

This is extremely problematic for Agamben because the State of Exception has allowed governments to commit grave crimes against humanity. He gives the example of Nazi concentration camps.
