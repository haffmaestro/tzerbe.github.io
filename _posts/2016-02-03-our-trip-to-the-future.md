Roy Bendor’s interactive, interdisciplinary instillation Sustainability in an Imaginary World transported me from the rainy and gray Vancouver morning of Friday, January 29th to a universe of unexplored possibilities and imaginings about our future. It was designed precisely to open up conversations around sustainability and what kind of world we want to live in.

But the instillation wasn’t designed to engage the logical mind. They don’t spew facts at you about our rapidly changing climate, ecosystem degradation, or how many earths it would take for your greedy ass to continue enjoying that beloved Starbucks frappe every morning. Sustainability in an Imaginary World introduces experiences and feelings of utopia, dystopia, technological connection and disconnection, hope, fear, curiosity and everything in between. This is the remarkable thing about it – it really makes you feel. And it gives your feelings a physical space to manifest.

I have always been in awe of the communicative power of art. It is extraordinarily hard to explain your reality to another person. Even as I sit here trying to describe to you, reader, my experience in Roy’s exhibit, I am frustrated at the futility of my words. So, let’s keep making and interacting with art! It’s an important channel for understanding each other and the world around us.
