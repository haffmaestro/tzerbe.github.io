Everybody has stress. It is not a status symbol. Yours is not more or less important than anyone else’s. Everybody has pain. Yours is not greater or lesser than anyone else’s. You should never try to compare your pain and use it to invalidate somebody else’s emotions. Egotism like that has no place in dialogue, and is detrimental to the cohesion, love, tolerance, and respect of healthy communities.

Another item on the very long list of amazing things about Scandinavia is the concept of Janteloven. This translates to “The Law of Jante” and it governs many aspects of the Scandinavian social landscape. The “law” was written by a Norwegian and Danish author, Aksel Sandemose, in his book En Flytning Krysser Sitt Spor. The rough translation of the law is as follows:

You’re not to think you are anything special.
You’re not to think you are better than us.
You’re not to think you are smarter than us.
You’re not to convince yourself that you are as good as us.
You’re not to think you know more than us.
You’re not to think you are more important than us.
You’re not to think you are good at anything.
You’re not to laugh at us.
You’re not to think anyone cares about you.
You’re not to think you can teach us anything.
