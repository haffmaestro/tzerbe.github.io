The gaps and cracks in Canada’s public school system are widening with the increased privatization of education – they have opened up into giant, mile-wide crevasses, actually. Students in every landscape are falling into them and breaking their legs at the bottom. Their peers, teachers, and communities have to move on without them. They are left staring up at the tiny amount of light trickling through the opening that now looks like a sliver in the distance.

This analogy is particularly apt for Vancouver’s public school system nestled in the lower mainland of beautiful, mountainous British Columbia. Every year, the Province splits education funding more and more unevenly between public and private school. Currently, private schools get between 40-60% of what public schools receive in provincial funding. Keep in mind that these are taxpayer dollars that are supposed to fund public amenities.
Furthermore, the private primary and secondary schools generate immense profit off of their astronomical tuitions. They are thus able to pay their teachers better, keep classroom capacities lower, and effectively become sinkholes for money and talent out of public schools. The public schools then loose the much-needed diversity that keeps the system healthy and funded. BC’s public school system now more closely resembles the American public school system.

Over the next fifteen years, the Vancouver Public School Board may be forced to close up to thirteen public schools. In total, there are only 77 elementary main schools, 15 elementary annexes, and 18 secondary schools in the Vancouver school district. This prospect has ignited fierce opposition from the community. For obvious reasons, closing schools in a city that is already experience youth-flight due to housing unaffordability is bad.
Youth are the lifeblood of a community and currently they are being choked out by Vancouver’s public infrastructure.
