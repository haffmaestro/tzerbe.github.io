The 'sharing economy' is defined on Wikipedia as: 'peer-to-peer-based sharing of access to goods and services coordinated through community-based online services.' Examples of sharing economies are Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Craigslist, etc. This economic model has the potential to disrupt voracious consumerism, increase social cohesion, and be less resource intensive than our current system. As Trebor Scholz puts it, the concept of a 'sharing economy' is practically huggable!

'Access, not possession,' is the mantra of this system. However, is the sharing economy truly accessible to all people? Or, is lack of digital literacy and social capital preventing some people from participating? Think, for example, of a homeless person trying to participate on Airbnb. The first step is to gain access to the necessary technology (a smart phone or a computer). This is the first major barrier. The second step is to create a profile that somehow portrays a clean, charming, sociable individual who one would trust renting out their home to. Another considerable barrier. These two things alone are enough to exclude a huge amount of people from the sharing economy, so long as it is facilitated by technology. There are considerable dangers of continuing economic exclusion with the concept of the sharing economy.
