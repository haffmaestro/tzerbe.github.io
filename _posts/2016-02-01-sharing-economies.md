The 'sharing economy' is defined on Wikipedia as: 'peer-to-peer-based sharing of access to goods and services coordinated through community-based online services.' Examples of sharing economies are Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Craigslist, etc. This economic model has the potential to disrupt voracious consumerism, increase social cohesion, and be less resource intensive than our current system. As Trebor Scholz puts it, the concept of a 'sharing economy' is practically huggable!

'Access, not possession,' is the mantra of this system. However, is the sharing economy truly accessible to all people? Or, is lack of digital literacy and social capital preventing some people from participating? Think, for example, the enormous number of people that are excluded from a sharing economy because of lack of access to technology (computers and phones) that facilitates the sharing.
