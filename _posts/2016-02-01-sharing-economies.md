The 'sharing economy' is defined as: 'peer-to-peer-based sharing of access to goods and services coordinated through community-based online services.' 'Access, not possession,' is the mantra of this system.

Is the sharing economy truly accessible to all people? Or, is lack of digital literacy and social capital preventing some people from participating?
