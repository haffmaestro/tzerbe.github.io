I have a lot of anxieties about climate change. I hate the image that I have in my head of a dying world where biodiversity dwindles and ecosystems slowly degrade and there is no more green and living beings are suffering. I am also anxious about the possibility for climate change to catalyze global conflict.

I recently read an article published in PNAS titled, [Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought,''](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.full) that really peaked and confirmed my fears. Researchers from UC Santa Barbara and Columbia analyzed the long-term trend of warming and eventual 3-year drought in the Fertile Crescent, which they concluded was not likely caused by natural forces alone. This means human influences likely had an impact on the region's climate system. In turn, they explain, this killed off crop and livestock and contributed to the geopolitical-economic instability of the area. 1.5 million people migrating from rural areas to the urban core as a result was the icing on the cake.

4.6 million Syrians have become refugee's as a result of this conflict (not to mention the 6.6 million internally displaced people). The rest of the world has been woefully unprepared to deal with this situation. We cannot figure out the legal status of people in such a circumstance. Does this make room for the possibility of a state of exception?
