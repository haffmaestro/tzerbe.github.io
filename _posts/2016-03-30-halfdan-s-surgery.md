Earlier this semester my boyfriend underwent a second surgery to remove a tumor in his knee. Before I knew him, he had developed a visible growth that made knee extension and impact increasingly painful. He saw a number of specialists who concluded that the growth was a cyst and it would likely not require further medical attention. About two years ago, he found out that this growth was actually a tumor and has since had two surgeries to remove it. Although it is benign, it has grown very aggressively and spread throughout the kneecap and backside of the knee extending up into the hamstring and down into the calf.

Halfdan went into surgery during our second week of dialogue and was admitted to the hospital for two days of recovery afterward. The process was emotional for him who is dealing with a health issue so far away from his family in Norway, as well as for me. We have learned a lot about what it means to emotionally support somebody as a partner. Partnership goes far beyond being in love. Being in love is easier.

He was unable to walk for about three weeks post-surgery and had to take some time off his job as a software developer. For anybody who has experienced bedrest or simply cabin fever, you know the emotional effects of staying indoors for a long period of time. Meanwhile, our dialogue class was in the early stages of acclimation. I tried to relay the intensity of my excitement and frustration at dialogue to him, but sometimes our emotional capacities were reached and so we would just lay and rest together.

Healthcare issues take up an amazing amount of emotional and physical space-time. I will never again take for granted the ease with which good health allows me to accomplish tasks that are essential to living.
