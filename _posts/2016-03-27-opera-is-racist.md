Madama Butterfly, one of the most famous operas ever written, is tangled up in ethnic exoticism, colonial legacy, sexism, racial stereotyping, and elitism that have long been present in traditional opera. Butterfly was written by an Italian composer about a young Japanese bride, usually played by performers of any Asian ethnic background, and her tumultuous marriage with an American WWII Lieutenant. It is problematic on many levels.

Butterfly represents a very narrow conception of what is “true opera” – alongside other famous works like Carmen, The Mikado, Turandot, and Rigoletto. Audiences and donors that subscribe to this concept are reluctant to allow opera to evolve beyond century-old ethnic clichés present in all of these works. They are still performed regularly by companies all around the world. The Metropolitan Opera in New York City, in fact, only recently stopped using blackface in their performances of Otello.

Opera’s stagnation has resulted in the alienation of their younger constituency and audiences who have outgrown offensive content. Does this spell death for one of the world’s most powerful art forms?
