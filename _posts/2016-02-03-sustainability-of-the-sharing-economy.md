[Sharing Economy: A Potential New Pathway to Sustainability](../../../../images/out.pdf)

Heinrichs' article "Sharing Economy: A Potential New Pathway to Sustainability" published in GAIA suggests that the sharing economy has much to offer sustainable development. He acknowledges, however, that there has been relatively little academic discourse on the sharing economy, and that the sustainability sciences should look more into the  socioenvironmental implications.
