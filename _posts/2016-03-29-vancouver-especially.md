Ken Lum, the artist who designed the East Van Cross, has recently installed a public art piece that is a commentary on Vancouver's famed housing affordability issues. The piece is called "Vancouver Especially" and is a small sculpture replica of the prefab, single-family dwellings which were built from 1965 to 1985 as an affordable housing design for poor families and immigrants called the "Vancouver Special".

"Vancouver Especially" is hosted by a public art space facilitated by artist-run gallery 221A at 271 Union Street in Chinatown, between Gore and Main streets.

Last year, Lum was given $45,000 to produce the art piece, which is approximately the same price of a Vancouver Special in the 1970s. His original intentions were to produce a Vancouver Special replica for the same price and a scale that is relative to the present day price of such a development. However, it was later determined that the size of the art piece would be far too small, so the dimensions of the installation were multiplied eightfold. The actual miniature dimensions are shown at the front of the exhibit on the side of the podium.
